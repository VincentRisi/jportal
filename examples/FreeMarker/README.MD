This directory contains examples of how to use the FreeMarker generator.

The FreeMarker Generator allows you to write your own SI File-based code generators.
You create a directory, put your templates (which are written in Freemarker syntax) in there,
and the Freemarker generator will scan directory for template files (ie. files ending in .ftl).
For each .ftl file, JPortal will generate a file.
